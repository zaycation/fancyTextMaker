This app was created in XCODE 10.3 as practice work for Swift 4. Application runs well amongst pretty much all devices and every iOS up until 13. It was tested once on an iPhone runing 13.2.2 and it seemed to display full functionality. Feel free to download this app, test it out, and mess around with the src if you'd like! Disclaimer: app has no app icons unfortunately.
